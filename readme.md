Playing battleships
===================

This repo will replicate the battleship kata in several languages for my own pleasure. 

This is just a learning repo, no fancy stuff in there

Python Battleship
-----------------
This is my first kata done in Python. Very basic command line enabled batleship game. 

Actually, this is very basic: single player with one square battleship to find in three tries max.

Just a learning repo I told you :)
